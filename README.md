## Bit Shifting
When data is deleted from a computer or storage device, it is not actually erased but rather marked as free space. This means that the data can still be recovered using various techniques, including bit shifting.
## Rainbow Tables
I couldn't figure out exercise 5. I discovered a ton of material about Rainbow Tables, but everything I read suggested downloading unreliable software and utilizing other programs. In Autopsy, I was unable to find out how to make a Rainbow Table. I think it has to do with building hash databases, but I was unable to figure out how to build one that would even be useful for password cracking. I worked with some of my classmates because we were all facing the same problem. Rainbow Tables, according to ChatGPT, are not going to be of any assistance to me because they can be misused for criminal password cracking. I greatly anticipate learning the answer to this.
